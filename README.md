Here's the add-on that allows to have custom fields added to ExpressionEngine 2 commenting system.

Note: if you’re looking for EE3 version, it has become part of Threaded Comments for ExpressionEngine 3

Currently supported types of custom fields are: Text Input and Textarea.

To enable custom fields and attachments to be submitted with the comments:
- Install module and extension
- Create custom fields using module’s Control Panel
- Add fields to the form by either adding html manually or by simply placing field as variable, e.g. {my_custom_field_name}. The latter approach will create all required HTML and is recommended.

To display custom fields inside comments, access them as variables by field name ({my_custom_field_name}). Viewing custom comment fields in CP is not yet possible.

Compatible both with EE Comment module and with Threaded Comments!
